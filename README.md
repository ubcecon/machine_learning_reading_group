# Possible Topics

## Methods 

### Supervised 

- Regularized regression : Lasso etc
  - Maybe a good starting point because it's not so different than linear regression. Could be covered quickly if we just go over the main idea, or could go deep into the statistical theory.
  
- Random Forests 
  - Maybe a good place to cover boosting & bagging too
  
- SVM

- Neural Networks
  - Feed forward
  - Recursive
  - Convolutional
  
- Classification 
  - All methods above can be used for classification, but there are classification specific things like all the classification metrics
  
- Reinforcement learning  
  
### Unsupervised  

- Clustering

- PCA, LDA
